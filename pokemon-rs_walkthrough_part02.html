                    <p>Route 104 connects Petalburg City with Rustboro City to the north and Route 105 to the south. The Petalburg Woods occupy the central part of the area. A cottage belonging to Mr. Briney is located on the south side, and the Pretty Petal Flower Shop stands on the north side.</p>

                    <p>The tall trees of Petalburg Woods block much of the sun's rays, leaving the interior cool and dark. Smaller trees restrict travel to the western side for now.</p>
                    <p>Deep inside the woods, you come across a researcher from Devon Corporation, a company based in Rustboro City. After explaining that he is looking for a Shroomish, he is suddenly confronted by a member of Team Magma/Team Aqua. The thug had planned to ambush the worker when he left the woods, but grew too impatient for that. Defeat him in battle and he flees the scene, but not before hinting that his friends are up to something in Rustboro. The grateful researcher gives you a Great Ball as thanks. He then heals your Pokémon, and rushes off to Rustboro after realizing what his attacker wanted.</p>

                    <p>The Pretty Petal Flower Shop is run by three sisters. The eldest sister teaches all visitors how to grow Berries. The middle sister hands out the Wailmer Pail when you first speak to her. The youngest sister will hand out one random Berry from a group of eight every day.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Rustboro City is the third largest city in Hoenn. Each of the buildings were constructed with stone, giving the city an old-fashioned feeling. The Pokémon Trainer's School, Devon Corporation headquarters, and Rustboro Gym are all located here.</p>
                    <p>Stop by the Cutter's house next to the Pokémon Center. When the city was expanding, he taught his Pokémon a move to help clear the surrounding land of trees. He no longer needs his HM01 (Cut), and gives it to you. In the field, Cut may be used to clear away small trees and tall grass.</p>
                    <p>Devon Corporation is headquartered in a large stone building in the northwest part of town. The company is responsible for manufacturing many of the items Trainers rely on every day, including several variations of Poké Ball and medicine. Only authorized personnel are allowed past the first floor.</p>
                    <p>The Pokémon Trainers' School stands to the northeast of the Pokémon Center. Talk with the teacher to receive a Quick Claw, and brush up on the basics by reading the notes on the blackboard.</p>
                    <p>The Rustboro Gym beckons, but before you step inside, visit the house to the east. Inside is a boy who is looking to trade his Makuhita for a Slakoth. Makuhita is a strong Fighting-type Pokémon that will be a big help inside the Gym. This one is even holding an X Attack to sweeten the deal.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets\pokemon-rs\walkthrough_part02\10Rustboro_Gym_RS.png" />

                    </div>

                    <p>The Rustboro Gym specializes in Rock-type Pokémon. Use Grass, Water, and Fighting moves to deal serious damage, and avoid battling with Fire-, Bug-, or Flying-type Pokémon. As hers is the first Gym in the Hoenn League, this graduate of the Pokémon Trainers' School has opted for a layout that gives novice Trainers a chance to avoid her subordinates and challenge the Gym Leader directly.</p>
                    <p>After winning the battle, Roxanne awards you the Stone Badge, which boosts your Pokémon's Attack by 10% and enables the use of Cut in the field. She also gives you TM39 (Rock Tomb) as a prize.</p>
                    <p>When you leave the Gym, you witness a Team Magma/Team Aqua Grunt escaping from the Devon Corporation building. That same Devon researcher from earlier is close behind, and chases the thief northward. He loses track of him in the northeast, where the city connects to Route 116.</p>

                    <h4 id="10_Route_116">10 Route 116</h4>
                    <div class="gameSS">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets\pokemon-rs\walkthrough_part02\11Hoenn_Route_116_RS.png" class="resize" />

                    </div>

                    <p>Route 116 runs east from Rustboro City. The well-traveled path is used by the workers tasked with construction of Rusturf Tunnel, a project that is now abandoned.</p>
                    <p>When you reach the entrance to Rusturf Tunnel, you find old Mr. Briney standing there. It seems that the thief has added kidnapping to his list of charges, as he has also made off with Mr. Briney's beloved Wingull, Peeko!</p>
                    <p>Rusturf Tunnel was a construction project by Devon Corporation that aimed to link Rustboro City and western Hoenn to the rest of the region. The tunnel was nearly complete when Devon's president, Mr. Stone, realized that the work was disturbing the local Whismur population. The project was canceled, though only a small bit of debris, easily cleared, remained to hinder travel.</p>

                    <h4 id="10_Rusturf_Tunnel">10.1 Rusturf Tunnel</h4>
                    <div class="gameSS">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets\pokemon-rs\walkthrough_part02\12Rusturf_Tunnel_RS.png" />

                        </figure>
                    </div>

                    <p>The tunnel is fairly small, so you will find the thief and his hostage shortly after you step inside. Defeat him, and he gives up the Devon Goods before fleeing. The old man rushes in to check on his Peeko, and introduces himself as Mr. Briney before the pair leaves for his cottage near Petalburg Woods.</p>

                    <h4 id="10_Rustboro_City">10.2 Rustboro City</h4>
                    <p>Now that you have reclaimed the Devon Goods, head back to the Devon Corporation building in Rustboro's northwest corner. The grateful Devon researcher is waiting on the city's east side, and hands you a Great Ball before escorting you inside to meet his boss.</p>
                    <p>On the third floor, the company president introduces himself as Mr. Stone. He thanks you for reclaiming the stolen parts, then asks for another favor. He doesn't expect you to work for free, of course, and rewards you with your very own PokéNav! In return, he asks that you deliver a Letter to a man named Steven in Dewford Town. To reach Dewford, you will need to cross the sea, so Mr. Stone suggests booking passage with Mr. Briney, the friendly old sailor from Route 104.</p>
                    <p>As you leave, take note of the Scientists on the second floor. None of them are having much luck with their projects, except one, who has developed a device that can resurrect ancient Pokémon from Fossils.</p>

                    <h4 id="10_PokeNav">10.3 PokéNav</h4>
                    <p>The PokéNav is a small, electronic device produced by Devon Corporation under the orders of Mr. Stone, who wanted a way to keep track of a Pokémon's feelings. It has four different functions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>-The Map page displays a map of Hoenn, along with the user's current location. It's also possible to zoom in to see a basic layout of towns and cities.</li>
                        <li>-The Condition page shows a Pokémon's five Contest stats in detail. It can be used to search for party Pokémon, or all owned Pokémon at once.</li>
                        <li>-The Trainer's Eyes function records data of up to 69 unique Trainers and will alert the user when any want a rematch. The only requirement is that the user must have obtained five Badges.</li>
                        <li>-The Ribbons page displays all Ribbons the user's Pokémon have acquired. Though hidden initially, this function unlocks when any of the user's Pokémon gains a Ribbon.</li>
                    </ul>
